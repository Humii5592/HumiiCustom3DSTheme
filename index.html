    <title>Humii's Website - Custom 3DS Theme</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My custom 3DS Home Menu Theme</h1>
    <p>A custom Nintendo 3DS Home Menu Theme!</p>
    <p>Made with 3DS Theme Editor (https://github.com/usagirei/3DS-Theme-Editor)</p>
    <p>To use this theme you must need:</p>
    <p>The theme itself (https://github.com/Humii5592/HumiiCustom3DSTheme/releases)</p>
    <p>A theme manager like Anenome (https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS/releases) or Themely (https://github.com/ihaveamac/Themely/releases)</p>
    <p>Plug in your 3DS's SD Card into your computer and download the theme then save it to:</p>
    <p>SD:\Themes\</p>
    <p>Plug in the SD Card, power on your 3DS and launch your desired theme manager. Then install the theme and it should show up!</p>
    <p>Note: For users who already use custom themes, make a shuffle list for some of your themes (maybe like 10 or 11 or less if you don't have that many) and continiously power your device on and off until the theme shows up.</p>
