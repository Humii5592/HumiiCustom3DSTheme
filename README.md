A custom Nintendo 3DS Home Menu Theme! Made with 3DS Theme Editor (https://github.com/usagirei/3DS-Theme-Editor)

To use this theme you must need:

The theme itself (found in the releases page, download the latest one you see)
A theme manager like Anenome (https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS/releases) or Themely (https://github.com/ihaveamac/Themely/releases)

Plug in your 3DS's SD Card into your computer and download the theme then save it to:

SD:\Themes\

Plug in the SD Card, power on your 3DS and launch your desired theme manager. Then install the theme and it should show up!



Note: For users who already use custom themes, make a shuffle list for some of your themes and continiously powr your device on and off until the theme shows up.
